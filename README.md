 ðŸ“Š Task 3 â€“ Writing Basic SELECT Queries
ðŸ“Œ Objective

The purpose of this task is to practice how to retrieve and filter data from a database using basic SQL `SELECT` queries. I used a sample `employees` table and performed various queries to fetch, filter, sort, and limit the data.


 ðŸ§° Tools Used

- DB Browser for SQLite  
  *or*  
- MySQL Workbench


ðŸ§ª What I Did

âœ… Created a table named **`employees`** with the following fields:
- `emp_id` (Primary Key)
- `name`
- `department`
- `age`
- `salary`
- `hire_date`

âœ… Inserted sample data for 4 employees.

âœ… Wrote the following SQL queries:
1. `SELECT *` â€“ Show all data
2. `SELECT name, department` â€“ Show specific columns
3. `WHERE` â€“ Filter employees in IT department
4. `AND` â€“ Filter by department and salary
5. `OR` â€“ Show employees in either IT or HR
6. `LIKE` â€“ Filter names starting with 'Y'
7. `BETWEEN` â€“ Filter salary between 50,000 and 70,000
8. `ORDER BY` + `LIMIT` â€“ Show top 3 employees with lowest salary
